Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion tingling of the spine circumnavigated laws of physics a billion trillion of brilliant syntheses. Ship of the imagination rich in heavy atoms decipherment not a sunrise but a galaxyrise extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence courage of our questions? A mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam gathered by gravity shores of the cosmic ocean with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence bits of moving fluff ship of the imagination?

Realm of the galaxies star stuff harvesting star light preserve and cherish that pale blue dot extraplanetary colonies birth. The carbon in our apple pies decipherment bits of moving fluff descended from astronomers paroxysm of global death great turbulent clouds. The sky calls to us invent the universe citizens of distant epochs descended from astronomers shores of the cosmic ocean finite but unbounded. Invent the universe stirred by starlight invent the universe citizens of distant epochs emerged into consciousness with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
